# OpenSWE1R: An Open-Source port of Star Wars Episode 1 Racer

This is an open-source port of the 1999 Game "Star Wars Episode 1 Racer".

You will still need the original game for it's art assets: levels, sounds, ...

Currently, not all functions are implemented in the open-source portion.
Therefore, this project also still relies on the original games code.

## Goals

The goal is to eventually replace all of the original code with an open-source equivalent.
The code is supposed to be clean, accurate and portable.
It's not a goal to fix any bugs or modify the games behaviour.
If you want to do such things, they should stay in a fork.

An exception is platform-independence and improvements to the overall code quality.
Some compromises are acceptable.
Please talk to the maintainers if you have a specific case.

It's possible that support for other versions (Mac / Dreamcast / N64) will be added later.
For now, the goal is to support the x86 Windows Version of the game.
